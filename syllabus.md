# Physical Computing Workshop (October 15-18, 2019)

A workshop led by Anna Xamb√≥ (anna.xambo@ntnu.no).

The code exercises and slides for the Physical Computing Workshop delivered at the [Music Communication Technology program](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mmct) (NTNU-UiO).

## Dates

* Tuesday 15 October, 2019, 9:00-16:00
* Wednesday 16 October, 2019, 9:00-16:00
* Thursday 17 October, 2019, 9:00-16:00
* Friday 18 October, 2019, 9:00-16:00


## Course Description

The aim of this workshop is to explore intuitively physical computing and interactive systems applied to music performance. This workshop will combine daily practical lectures with team fieldwork to conclude with an informal "network music performance" with the prototypes built each day. The last day of the workshop will be a mini-hackathon where each team is expected to ideate, prototype and present/perform with the prototype at the end of the session.  The evaluation of the workshop will be based on the daily activity and two group blog posts reflecting on topics explored in the workshop. 

## Workshop Design Criteria

* Facilitate a hands-on workshop with affordable and DIY technologies (e.g. contact microphones, unmounted speakers, Bela, Pd)
* Explore individually and in group the fundamental concepts behind physical computing (e.g. tinkering, programming, making).
* Promote a sharing culture of code and discoveries (e.g. writing reflective blog posts, sharing code repositories).
* Contextualize the workshop to the broader context of interactive systems for music performance at both theoretical and practical levels (e.g. readings, practices).

## Learning Outcomes

* Develop skills of computational thinking and programming.
* Explore how to create a prototype of an interactive system for music performance with low-tech technologies.
* Discover iterative design and the possibilities of network music by performing with own-built prototypes.
* Develop critical thinking skills applied to reflection on artistic practice and instrument building.

## Grading

The Physical Computing workshop is evaluated with a Pass/Fail grade.
Attendance is required to pass because the workshop consist of practical group work, collective participation and discussion.
Active engagement in the tasks at hand is also required to pass.
